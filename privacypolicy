Nikers — Privacy Policy (lol)


What We Collect

Nothing.
We wouldn’t even know how, we don’t care.

Seriously, We Don’t Care About Your Stuff

We built this bot for fun, it's like a stupid lil' son to us, not for data mining. If you’re worried about your privacy just look at the code (sorry again) (why would you even want to use this) 

BUT — Google Might care about your stuff (!!!!!!) 

When you use the Gemini (Google GenAI) feature, your question goes to Google, not us. That means Google might collect or process that information according to their own terms and privacy policies.

[Google AI Privacy & Terms](https://policies.google.com/terms)

So just keep that in mind when asking stuff through the bot.

Final Word

We don’t collect anything. We don't know how and we don't care, yes we're very stupid
If that ever changes (it won’t), we’ll update this.
